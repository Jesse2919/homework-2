# homework-2

 Description: This website is my first porfolio it intels of my homework projects I have done in  my coding boot camp. 
 As well as a few things about myself. 
 I also went ahead and added a picture of me to show the user how I look like in  real life. Doing this project was very difficult for me since I came from a zero experience background.
 Although I tried my best and felt very forfilled on how it came out.
 I also went ahead and added my contact information so feel free to contact me if you have any questions.


Programming languages: 
So in this profolio I used CSS as well as HTMl. 
Although most of my coding was in CSS to format and style my website.
